# Flutter Application

This is a Flutter application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- You have set up an editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
- You have an emulator or a physical device to run the application.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application up and running:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone 
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```sh
flutter pub get
```
### 3. Run the Application
You can run the application on an emulator or a physical device.

On an Emulator
Start the emulator:

  Open Android Studio.
  Go to AVD Manager.
  Start an emulator.
  Run the application:
  
``` sh
flutter run
```

### 4. Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following command:
```sh
flutter test
```
### 5. Gradle Wrapper Properties
The gradle-wrapper.properties file contains the following configuration:

``` dart
distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.9-bin.zip
networkTimeout=10000
validateDistributionUrl=true
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
```
### 6. Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, try the following:

  Ensure that all dependencies are installed by running flutter pub get.
  
  Ensure that your Flutter SDK is up to date by running flutter upgrade.
  
  Ensure that your device or emulator is properly set up and connected.
